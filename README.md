In this analysis, we will explore three different areas of Miami Universities Farmer School of Business. The first area to be explored is the graduate programs offered and the success that they provide students. We will analyze whether these programs tend to result in higher salaries and hiring rates for those who participate in them. The second area we will explore is the success of first-generation students, as the success of these students is a good indicator of educational quality at a university. Therefore, we will compare first generation students to non first generation students in the achieving of latin honors and hiring rates. Along with this, we will also look at common companies that hire Miami students as a whole, and those those that hire more first generation students. Our third area will look at Miami students post graduation. Specifically, we will analyze post graduation employment rates and average starting salary.
